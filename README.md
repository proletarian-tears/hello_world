# hello_world
This is a test repo, probably will add some misc. stuff into it later


This is not realy a manual, just a necessity for the tutorial. Perhaps later I can make this into a blog?
Right now a have got a couple of ideas, in the future I will try to spend for time on them, and keep
them updated here.
